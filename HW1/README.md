    level 3 - hedge maze
    level 4 - zen pool

    Don't take too much damage from radiation as you clean up the lab.
    Make it to the end to win!

4. Collectables
    -healthpack: restores 10 health on pickup
    -radioactive macaroni: goal objective

5. Health
    -players take damage as they pick up the macaroni
    -players heal from healthpacks

6. Respawn
    Death respawns players at the beginning.

7. Game Difficulty
    I did not implement different difficulty levels for the game but I made each room harder than the last.

8. Progression
    All of the locked doors are labeled with their required macaroni.

9. Obstacles
    Players must jump onto platforms and across gaps. Players must also navigate a maze and one puzzle.

10. Scoring
    The game will keep track of your total macaroni collected.
    Players cash in macaroni to open doors and progress, so their current mac will change, but total keeps track across the rooms.

11. Sound Effects
    SFX - from UE5 starter assets
    background audio - "Zero Hour"
