Christmas Crisis!
You need to warm up your band before making the rounds for Christmas caroling!
Grab your conductor's baton and cue each player to play by pointing and pressing the trigger.
Practice the C major scale with each player at least twice before moving on to the main program.
(Hint: you can hear the full scale from the example score on the left.)
From there you can have fun conducting the players in a round!
Metronomes are provided for the appropriate tempos for both pieces and will continue to keep time after they're cued.
